Good afternoon everyone!

    I am glad to be here for this interview.  First I will introduce myself briefly.  My name is Zhao Yafei, 28 years old. My hometown is Henan province. Right now, I am a doctor candidate from Zhejiang University, majoring in Fundamental Mathematics. I will obtain my doctor degree in this July. My research is mainly focus on Operator Algebra and Operator Space. In my pursuit of doctor degree, I have finished 2 SCI papers and got 1 Outstanding Graduate Student Award. 

    Before I studied in Zhejiang University, I received my bachelor degree in Henan Normal University, majoring in Computational Mathematics. I graduated from there with excellent remarks in Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability Theory.

    The year before last, I was very lucky to stay here as a substitute teacher, teaching Higher Mathematics for autumn and winter semester. During that period, I found teaching is the very ideal job for me and I was also doing well. 

    Right now, I have been married and settled down in Hangzhou. I have a lovely child who is 1 year old. All in all, here is the place I have long admired. And I belive that I am qualified for admission into your university. I deeply hope I will have the opportunity to work here and study from your all.  Many thanks!
